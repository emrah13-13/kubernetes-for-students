> A hands-on learning journey through Kubernetes - because nobody learns distributed systems by reading 12 pages of YAML

## Who Is This For?

You're a computer science or software engineering student who:
- Heard about "Kubernetes" but still confused why we need an orchestra for containers
- Already learned Docker and thinking "okay I can run containers, now what?"
- Preparing for interviews or internships at tech companies using cloud-native stacks
- Want to understand DevOps but afraid of drowning in technical documentation
- Have a class assignment or capstone project requiring distributed system deployment

## Why Learn Kubernetes?

**Market Reality:**
- 94% of organizations use containers in production (CNCF Survey 2024)
- Kubernetes skills can increase salary by 25-40% for entry-level DevOps roles
- Top companies hiring: Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Netflix, Spotify, Uber
- Average Kubernetes engineer salary: $120k-180k (US market, 2025)

**Career Opportunities:**
- DevOps Engineer
- Cloud Engineer
- Site Reliability Engineer (SRE)
- Platform Engineer
- Full-stack Developer (modern stack)

Learning Kubernetes opens doors. Companies are literally throwing money at people who understand container orchestration.

## What Makes This Different?

**Not:**
- Official documentation used by production engineers (that already exists)
- Copy-paste YAML tutorials without understanding (internet has plenty of those)
- CKA certification speedrun (different goal)

**But:**
- Learning path that invites you to **experiment**, not just read
- Analogies that relate to everyday experiences
- Focus on "why" before "how"
- Hands-on challenges that make you truly understand, not just follow step-by-step

## How to Learn?

Each chapter has this structure:

1. **The Story** - Real-world analogy for the concept
2. **The Reality** - What's actually happening in Kubernetes
3. **The Experiment** - You run it yourself and see results
4. **The Breakdown** - Understand why it works (or fails)
5. **The Challenge** - Exercise to ensure you get it

## Learning Path

### Part 1: Foundation
Before you get lost in the cluster, you need to understand the map.

- **[Chapter 0: Setup Your Playground](./chapters/00-setup/)** - Install tools, setup minikube, don't get stuck at step 1
- **[Chapter 1: First Contact](./chapters/01-first-contact/)** - Meet the cluster without YAML overload
- **[Chapter 2: Pods - The Basic Unit](./chapters/02-pods/)** - Container vs Pod, and why you need to distinguish them

### Part 2: Core Concepts
These are components you'll use 90% of the time working with Kubernetes.

- **[Chapter 3: Deployments - The Copy Machine](./chapters/03-deployments/)** - Scaling, rolling updates, and self-healing that's not magic
- **[Chapter 4: Services - The Traffic Director](./chapters/04-services/)** - How pods communicate when their IP addresses keep changing
- **[Chapter 5: ConfigMaps & Secrets - Configuration Done Right](./chapters/05-config/)** - Externalize configuration the professional way
- **[Chapter 6: Persistent Storage - Data That Survives](./chapters/06-storage/)** - Volumes, PVCs, and storage that outlives pods
- **Chapter 7: Ingress - The Front Door** - Coming soon
- **Chapter 8: Debugging & Troubleshooting** - Coming soon
- **Chapter 9: Best Practices** - Coming soon
- **Chapter 10: Capstone Projects** - Coming soon

## Prerequisites

What you need:
- **Docker basics** - At least know how to build and run containers
- **Command line** - Comfortable in terminal, not afraid to type commands
- **Basic networking** - Understand IP addresses, ports, HTTP requests
- **Laptop** - 8GB RAM minimum (16GB recommended), dual-core CPU or better
- **Time** - 2-4 hours per chapter if you actually do the experiments

What's NOT required:
- Production DevOps experience
- Cloud certifications
- Dedicated server or cloud credits

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone this repo
git clone https://github.com/0xReLogic/kubernetes-for-students.git
cd kubernetes-for-students

# Start from setup
cd chapters/00-setup
cat README.md
```

## Learning Philosophy

### 1. Experiment First, Theory Second
You'll break things first, then understand why it matters. More effective than reading theory for 2 hours then forgetting everything.

### 2. Real Failures, Real Learning
Error messages are the best teachers. Each chapter has "Common Mistakes" designed for you to encounter.

### 3. Progressive Complexity
Start simple, gradually add layers. No surprises like "oh turns out you need advanced networking for chapter 2".

### 4. Context Over Memorization
You don't need to memorize all kubectl commands. Just understand concepts, the rest can be googled or AI-assisted.
